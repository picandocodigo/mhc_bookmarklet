# Mile High Comics Bookmarklet

This is a simple bookmarklet to use with the [Mile High Comics website](http://www.milehighcomics.com).

Through [Mile High Comic's newsletter](http://www.milehighcomics.com/newsletter/), you can access special discounts with codewords which apply once you checkout. Use the bookmarklet when looking at comics lists on the site. It asks you what the current discount is (20%, 30%, etc.) and applies it to the price of the comics being shown.

The jQuery Bookmarklet code is base on @jrcryer's [jquery-bookmarklet-boilerplate](http://github.com/jrcryer/jquery-bookmarklet-boilerplate).
